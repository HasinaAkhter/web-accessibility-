        We can fix that by adding a caption tag and

	  <!---It's much easier for a user to read the summary information
           if they're using a screen reader or a braille display
           rather than navigate the table and have to figure it out as they go along
		   The contents of the summary attribute won't actually be displayed on your site,
           but it could be another opportunity for you to describe the contents of the table
           to your users-->
